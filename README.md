This is my personal website powered by Python3, Flask and Jinja2.
This may be my millionth iteration of a personal website, however the second since I actually started learning webdev "for real".
The current design is horizontal scrolling of "UI Cards" and it works surprisingly well.

The cards data is stored in a JSON "database", `data.json`.
[I made a simple JSONeditor dedicated to write these cards into the database](https://github.com/IAmBullsaw/JsonEditor) which works pretty well now that I added links to each card.

The site is currently deployed at Heroku, which works really well.

This project is not highly prioritized as of now and Issues is what's "currently being worked on".
