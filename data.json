	"I had to start somewhere so I actually started with the smallest piece, this Card.",
	"card.py is responsible for the data this card holds, such as this text, paths to header image and the possibility to hold even more pictures (However I have not implemented this in any card. (Yet...))",
	"After building a cardclass I began building the website implementation in Flask. This part was actually really fun since I've been working with Flask before and everything just came together, but as a horrible eye-sore since no CSS were applied. That was the next step.",
	"I think I wrestled with the CSS like a madman. I have yet to try out Less, Sass and all those really nice tools. I just went at it like a caveman. After an insane amount of headache inducing 'width: 100%', I found out that the smart thing is to divide the website in rows and columns. This helped an insane amount with the overall size issues I had... We should however not talk about designing mobile-friendly websites. That is a thing of this sites future.",
	"To make the cards act like I wanted them to I had to use Javascript. Before I continue to ramble on and on, I feel like I have to tell you that I never intended to use Javascript for a website. Somehow it feels that a website only gets more complicated to use when one needs to take this magical tool in use. However, I wanted to try this card-thing out!",
	"So, I made one function to 'flip over' and show its back. With some CSS magic I made it grow into a larger thing, the one you're reading now. I am still not sure if this is a good move. It was however fun and some of my friends actually said 'Hey, that is nice'. I am already thinking about a simpler website design, but scrolling sideways, that's something else, isn't it?",
	"Well well. Next thing to implement here, besides one of the million things I want to do, is the mobile-friendly css. I am however surprised that the side-scrolling magically works 'At least on my machine'-style."
